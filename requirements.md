I want to make a well designed simple functionality website 

Website name = FF Paid Likes

Idea - 
My idea is that this website Free Fire a Game's Players can visit and buy Free Fire Profile likes. If they buy we will give them likes depending on the amount.

Make a modern attracting landing Page.
Just after the landing page, make home page where various plans are being shown.
------------------------------ 1000 rupees for 1500 Likes && 500 rupees for 700 Likes 
If they purchase, they get a form where they have to fill details like Name, FF UID, tick - untick Agreement for own risk,etc and if the purchase is successful then redirect them to a successful page and list the details of the person in the Admin page which admins can see.
If purchase fails then no datas are being saved in the admin page.
Also make a contact page where they can contact us on support@FFLikes@gmail.com

I want to use 
Backend - Supabase (alaways provide me the sql code i will paste them and if any other thing is there then guide me for supabase)

Payment - Cashfree (ask me if Api key or anything is required )
